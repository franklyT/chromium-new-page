========

Tabby Tab is a chromium new-tab extension based upon the earnest notions of simplicity, ease of use, and light-hearted fun.

Its primary goal as a project was to action an idea I had; a serverless high-resolution favicon scraper.

Using a variety of techniques for scraping HTML, the extension will request and parse your topsites and recently visited sites in real time, plucking out the most promising candidates for a high resolution icon using a minimal amount of trial-and-error attempts.
